Project description:

Our web application can be used by three different types of persons: Governments/organizations, community residents, and administrative body.

The platform includes features for user registration, project proposal submission, community voting, sponsorship opportunities, real-time funding tracking, community interaction, reporting, and administrative control.

How our data was created:
Realistic data was created using Mockaroo. We made sure to match data on which users liked which posts and the blooms and withers. We acquired real Lehigh Valley zipcodes using https://www.zillow.com/browse/homes/pa/lehigh-county/. Our ER diagram included four different tables consisting of Interactions, Users, Ideas, and Funding. 
The Interactions table keeps track of the interactions made on a post such as if it was reported, liked, disliked, and on what post by which user.
The Users table keeps track of the users and the usual data while also keeping track of the type of user.
The Funding table keeps track of which government official has funded which project. This helps us with real-time tracking of funding data.
